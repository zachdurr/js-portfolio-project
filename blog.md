Making this project was difficult in nature because learning javascript in 4 weeks was difficult in nature! That said by the time I was writing my last bit of code and debugging an error - I found myself enjoying the search for the error and moreso the level of understanding I now have for Javascript compared to when I started just over a month ago. I wanted to continue to build on my Job Search Organizer and I felt it was a good way to show that I could correctly display my associations as well as my database info using the JS tools I've picked up!
